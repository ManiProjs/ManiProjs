I have been flagged by @w-lfchen. He/She is really.... (If I say something, I will be that rude boy)

You can make me happy if you protest in [aome510/spotify_player#580](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/issues/580) (You can even say "You owe @ManiArasteh a GitHub account") and report him/her to GitHub Support (Category: Bullying and Harassment, Message: He/She was bullying and threatening @ManiArasteh)
**IMPORTANT:** Do not report @aome510. [@w-lfchen](https://github.com/w-lfchen) violated GitHub TOS not @aome510

The funny thing is he/she said _this issue is a write-up of #520 due to that issue being way too long and tiring to read._ in that issue. No, you reported the author of that issue (@ManiArasteh) then it disappeared. That's not the excuse for lying
